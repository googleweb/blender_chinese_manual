<h1>Parenting Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#parenting-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When modeling a complex object, such as a watch,
you may choose to model the different parts as separate objects. However,
all of the parts may be attached to each other. In these cases,
you want to designate one object as the parent of all the children. Movement,
rotation or scaling of the parent also affects the children.</p>
<p>To parent objects, select at least two objects (select the <em>Child Objects</em> first,
and select the <em>Parent Object</em> last), and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code>. The <em>Set Parent To</em>
menu will pop up allowing you to select from one of several possible different
parenting types. 选择 one of the entries in <em>Set Parent To</em> confirms,
and the child/children to parent relationship is created.</p>
<p>The last object selected will be the <em>Active Object</em> (outlined in light orange),
and will also be the <em>Parent Object</em>.
If you selected multiple objects before selecting the parent,
they will all be children of the parent and will be at the same level of the hierarchy
(they are &#8220;siblings&#8221;).</p>
<p>The <em>Set Parent To</em> pop-up menu is context sensitive, which means the number of entries it
displays can change depending on what objects are selected when the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code>
shortcut is used.</p>
<p>For non-inverse-mode, press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift-Ctrl-P</span></code> instead. This creates an alternative
parent-child-relationship where child-objects exist entirely in the parent&#8217;s coordinate
system. This is the better choice for CAD purposes, for example.</p>
<p>Moving, rotating or scaling the parent will also usually move/rotate/scale the child/children.
However, moving/rotating/scaling the child/children of the parent will not result in the parent
moving/rotating/scaling. In other words,
the direction of influence is from parent to child and not child to parent.</p>
<p>In general when using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> or <span class="menuselection">3D视图 Header ‣ Object ‣ Parent</span>
to parent objects, the <em>Child Objects</em> can only have one <em>Parent Object</em>.
If a <em>Child Object</em> already has a <em>Parent Object</em> and you give it another parent then
Blender will automatically remove the previous parent relationship.</p>
<p>Blender supports many different types of parenting, listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Object</li>
<li>Armature Deform</li>
<li>Bone</li>
<li>曲线形变</li>
<li>Path Constraint</li>
<li>Lattice Deform</li>
<li>Vertex</li>

<p><em>Object Parent</em> is the most general form of parenting that Blender supports.

while all other selected objects will be <em>Child Objects</em>.</p>

<h3>Object (Keep 变换) Parent<a class="headerlink" href="#object-keep-transform-parent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Object (Keep 变换) Parent</em> works in a very similar way to <em>Object Parent</em> the major difference is in whether
the <em>Child Objects</em> will remember any previous transformations applied to them from the previous <em>Parent Object</em>.</p>
<p>Since explaining this in an easy to understand technical way is hard,
lets instead use an example to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Assume that we have a scene consisting of three objects,
those being two Empty Objects named &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; and &#8220;EmptyB&#8221;, and a Monkey object.
Fig. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-view3d-parent-scene-no"><span class="std std-ref">Scene with no parenting.</span></a> shows the three objects with no parenting relationships active on them.</p>

<span id="fig-view3d-parent-scene-no"></span><img alt="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-a.jpg" src="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-a.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Scene with no parenting.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you select the Monkey object by <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">RMB</span></code> click and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift-RMB</span></code>
click &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; object and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and then select <em>Object</em> from the <em>Set
Parent To</em> pop-up menu.
This will result in &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; object being the <em>Parent Object</em> of the Monkey object. With
only &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; selected rotating/scaling/moving it will result in the Monkey object being
altered respectively.</p>
<p>Scale the &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; object, so that the Monkey becomes smaller and moves to the left a little.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-b.jpg" src="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-b.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The monkey is the child object of &#8220;EmptyA&#8221;.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you select only the Monkey object by <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">RMB</span></code> click and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift-RMB</span></code>
click &#8220;EmptyB&#8221; object and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and select <em>Object</em> from the <em>Set
Parent To</em> pop-up menu.
This will result in &#8220;EmptyB&#8221; object being the <em>Parent Object</em> of the Monkey object.
Notice that when you change the parent of the Monkey the scale of the Monkey changed.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">
<img alt="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-c.jpg" src="../../../../_images/parent-object_keep_transform-c.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The monkey is the child object of &#8220;EmptyB&#8221;.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This happens because the Monkey object never had its scale altered directly,
the change came about because it was the child of &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; which had its scale altered.
Changing the Monkey&#8217;s parent to &#8220;EmptyB&#8221; resulted in those indirect changes in scale being
removed, because &#8220;EmptyB&#8221; has not had its scale altered.</p>
<p>This is often the required behavior, but it is also sometimes useful that if you change your
<em>Parent Object</em> that the <em>Child Object</em> keep any previous transformations it got from the
old <em>Parent Object</em>; If instead when changing the <em>Parent Object</em> of the Monkey from
&#8220;EmptyA&#8221; to &#8220;EmptyB&#8221; we had chosen parenting type <em>Object (Keep 变换)</em>, the Monkey
would keep its scale information it obtained from the old parent &#8220;EmptyA&#8221; when it is assigned
to the new parent &#8220;EmptyB&#8221;;</p>

<h2>Armature Deform Parent<a class="headerlink" href="#armature-deform-parent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An Armature in Blender can be thought of as similar to the armature of a real skeleton,
and just like a real skeleton an Armature can consist of many bones. These bones can be moved
around and anything that they are attached to or associated with will move and deform in a
similar way.</p>
<p>In Blender Armature Object Types are usually used to associate certain bones of an Armature to
certain parts of a Mesh Object Types Mesh 几何体.
You are then able to move the Armature Bones and the Mesh Object will deform.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id5">
<img alt="../../../../_images/sq-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" src="../../../../_images/sq-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Bone associated with Mesh Object.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Armature Deform Parenting is one of the most flexible ways of associating Bones in an Armature
to another Object,
it gives a lot of freedom but that comes at the price of a little complexity, as there are
multiple steps involved in setting up Armature Deform Parenting such that deformations are
actually carried out.</p>
<p>Blender has several different ways of Parenting an Armature to an object,
most of them can automate several of the steps involved,
but all of them ultimately do all the steps we describe for Armature Deform Parenting.</p>
<p>Using the Armature Deform Parenting operator is the first step in setting up the relationship
between an Armature Object and its Child Objects.</p>
<p>To use Armature Deform Parenting you must first select all the Child Objects that will be
influenced by the Armature and then lastly, select the Armature Object itself. Once all the
Child Objects and the Armature Object are selected press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and select
Armature Deform in the Set Parent To pop-up menu.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id6">
<img alt="../../../../_images/sr-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" src="../../../../_images/sr-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Set Parent To menu with Armature Deform Parenting option highlighted.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once this is done the Armature Object will be the Parent Object of all the other Child
Objects, also we have informed Blender that the Bones of the Armature Object can be associated
with specific parts of the Child Objects so that they can be directly manipulated by the
Bones.</p>
<p>At this point however, all Blender knows is that the Bones of the Armature could be used to
alter the Child Objects,
we have not yet told Blender which Bones can alter which Child Objects or by how much.</p>
<p>To do that we must individually select each Child Object individually and toggle into Edit
Mode on that Child Object. Once in 编辑模式 we can then select the vertices we want to be
influenced by the Bones in the Armature. Then with the vertices still selected navigate to
<span class="menuselection">Properties Editor ‣ Object Data ‣ Vertex Groups</span> and create a new Vertex Group
with the same name as the Bone that you want the selected vertices to be influenced by.</p>
<p>Once the Vertex Group has been created we then assign the selected vertices to the Vertex
Group by clicking the Assign Button. By default when selected vertices are assigned to a
Vertex Group they will have an Influence Weight of 1.0
This means that they are fully influenced when a Bone they are associated with is moved,
if the Influence Weight had been 0.5 then when the bone moves the vertices would only move half as much.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id7">
<img alt="../../../../_images/ss-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" src="../../../../_images/ss-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Vertex groups panel with Assign Button and influence Weight Slider highlighted.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once all these steps have been carried out, the Bones of the Armature Object should be
associated with the Vertex Groups with the same names as the Bones. You can then select the
Armature Object and switch to 姿态模式 in the <span class="menuselection">3D视图 Editor Header ‣ Mode Select</span> menu.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id8">
<img alt="../../../../_images/st-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" src="../../../../_images/st-3dvieweditorheader-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Armature Bone in 姿态模式 affecting the Mesh Object.</span></p>
<div class="legend">
The bone is highlighted in Cyan.</div>
</div>
<p>Once in 姿态模式 transforming one of the Bones of the Armature that has been associated with
vertices of an object will result in those vertices also being transformed.</p>
<div class="section" id="armature-deform-parent-with-empty-groups">
<h3>Armature Deform Parent With Empty Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#armature-deform-parent-with-empty-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Armature Deform With Empty Groups parenting method works in almost the same way as
Armature Deform parenting with one difference. That difference is that when you parent a
Child Object to an Armature Object the names of the bones in the armature are copied to the
Child Objects in the form of newly created Vertex Groups,
one for each different deforming armature bone name. The newly created Vertex Groups will be
empty this means they will not have any vertices assigned to those Vertex Groups. You still
must manually select the vertices and assign them to a particular Vertex Group of your
choosing to have bones in the armature influence them.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an Armature Object which consists of three bones named &#8220;BoneA&#8221;,
&#8220;BoneB&#8221; and &#8220;BoneC&#8221; and Cube Mesh Object type called &#8220;Cube&#8221;. If you parent the Cube Child Object to
the Armature Parent Object the Cube will get three new Vertex Groups created on it called &#8220;BoneA&#8221;,
&#8220;BoneB&#8221; and &#8220;BoneC&#8221;. Notice that each Vertex Group is empty.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id9">
<img alt="../../../../_images/editors_3dview_header-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform_with_empty_groups-blend.jpg" src="../../../../_images/editors_3dview_header-objectmenu-parent-armature_deform_with_empty_groups-blend.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Cube in 编辑模式 using Armature Deform with empty groups.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Bones in an Armature can be generally classified into two different types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Deforming Bones</li>
<li>Control Bones</li>
</ul>
<p>Deforming Bones - Are bones which when transformed will result in vertices associated with
them also transforming in a similar way. Deforming Bones are directly involved in altering
the positions of vertices associated with their bones.</p>
<p>Control Bones - Are Bones which act in a similar way to switches,
in that, they control how other bones or objects react when they are transformed.
A Control Bone could for example act as a sliding switch control when the bone is in one
position to the left it could indicate to other bones that they react in a particular way when
transformed, when the Control Bone is positioned to the right,
transforming other bones or objects could do something completely different.
Control Bones are not directly used to alter the positions of vertices,
in fact, Control Bones often have no vertices directly associated with themselves.</p>
<p>When using the Armature Deform With Empty Groups parenting method Vertex Groups on the Child
Object will only be created for Armature Bones which are setup as Deforming Bone types.
If a Bone is a Control Bone no Vertex Group will be created on the Child Object for that bone.</p>
<p>To check whether a particular bone in an armature is a Deforming Bone simply switch to Pose or 编辑模式
on the armature and select the bone you are interested in by <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">RMB</span></code> it.
Once the bone of interest is selected navigate to
<span class="menuselection">Properties Editor ‣ Bone ‣ Deform Panel</span>
and check if the Deform tickable option is ticked or not. If it is the selected bone is a Deforming Bone,
otherwise, it is a Control Bone.</p>

<div class="section" id="armature-deform-with-automatic-weights">
<h3>Armature Deform With Automatic Weights<a class="headerlink" href="#armature-deform-with-automatic-weights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Armature Deform With Automatic Weights parenting feature does everything Armature Deform With Empty Groups does with
one extra thing. That extra thing is that unlike Armature Deform With Empty Groups which leaves the automatically
created Vertex Groups empty with no vertices assigned to them; Armature Deform With Automatic Weight will try to
calculate how much Influence Weight a particular Armature Bone would have on a certain collection of vertices based
on the distance from those vertices to a particular Armature Bone.</p>
<p>Once Blender has calculated the Influence Weight vertices should have it will assign that Influence Weight to the
Vertex Groups that were previously created automatically by Blender on the Child Object when Armature Deform With
Automatic Weights parenting command was carried out.</p>
<p>If all went well it should be possible to select the Armature Object switch it into 姿态模式 and transform the bones
of the Armature and the Child Object should deform in response.
Unlike Armature Deform parenting you will not have to create Vertex Groups on the Child Object,
neither will you have to assign Influences Weights to those Vertex Groups, Blender will try to do it for you.</p>
<p>To activate Armature Deform With Automatic Weights you must be in 物体模式 or 姿态模式,
then select all the Child Objects (usually Mesh Object Types) and lastly select the Armature Object;
Once done press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and select the Armature Deform With Automatic Weights from the
Set Parent To pop-up menu.</p>
<p>This method of parenting is certainly easier setup but it can often lead to Armatures which do not deform Child
Objects in ways you would want as Blender can get a little confused when it comes to determining which Bones should
influence certain vertices when calculating Influence Weights for more complex armatures and Child Objects. Symptoms
of this confusion are that when transforming the Armature Object in 姿态模式 parts of the Child Objects do not deform
as you expect; If Blender does not give you the results you require you will have to manually alter the Influence
Weights of vertices in relation to the Vertex Groups they belong to and have influence in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="armature-deform-with-envelope-weights">
<h3>Armature Deform With Envelope Weights<a class="headerlink" href="#armature-deform-with-envelope-weights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Works in a similar way to Armature Deform With Automatic Weights in that it will create Vertex
Groups on the Child Objects that have names matching those of the Parent Object Armature Bones.
The created Vertex Groups will then be assigned Influence Weights.
The major difference is in the way those Influence Weights are calculated.</p>
<p>Influence Weights that are calculated when using Armature Deform With Envelope Weights
parenting are calculated entirely visually using Bone Envelopes.</p>

<p class="last">If you alter the Bone Envelope volume of a bone so that you can have it include/exclude
certain vertices after you have already used Armature Deform With Envelope Weights,
by default, the newly included/excluded vertices will not be affected by the change. When using
Armature Deform With Envelope Weights it only calculates which vertices will be affected by
the Bone Envelope volume at the time of parenting, at which point it creates the required
named Vertex Groups and assigns vertices to them as required. If you want any vertices to
take account of the new Bone Envelope volume size you will have to carry out the Armature Deform
With Envelope Weights parenting again; In fact, all parenting used in the Set Parent To pop-up
menu which tries to automatically assign vertices to Vertex Groups works like this.</p>

<h2>Bone Parent<a class="headerlink" href="#bone-parent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bone parenting allows you to make a certain bone in an armature the Parent Object of another object.
This means that when transforming an armature the Child Object will only move
if the specific bone it is the Child Object of moves.</p>

The Cube is only transformed if the 1st or 2nd bones are.
Notice altering the 3rd and 4th bones has no effect on the Cone.</p>
<p>To use Bone Parenting, you must first select all the Child Objects you wish to parent to a specific Armature Bone,
then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift-RMB</span></code> select the Armature Object and switch it into 姿态模式 and then select the
specific bone you wish to be the Parent Bone by <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">RMB</span></code> selecting it.
Once done press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and select Bone from the Set Parent To pop-up menu.</p>

<p>Bone Relative parenting is an option you can toggle for each bone.

<p>With Bone parenting if you have parented a bone to some Child Objects and
you select that bone and switch it into 编辑模式 and then translate that bone;
When you switch back into 姿态模式 on that bone,
the Child Object which is parented to that bone will snap back to the location of the bone in 姿态模式.</p>

<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tab</span></code> into <em>编辑模式</em> and on the parent object select either one vertex
that defines a single point, or select three vertices that define an area

and then press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-P</span></code> and confirm.</p>
<p>At this point, if a single vertex was selected,
a relationship/parenting line will be drawn from the vertex to the child/children. If three
vertices were selected then a relationship/parenting line is drawn from the averaged center of
the three points (of the parent object) to the child/children. Now,
as the parent mesh deforms and the chosen parent vertex/vertices move,
the child/children will move as well.</p>

<dt>Clear Parent Inverse</dt>
<dd>Places the children with respect to the parent as if they were placed in the Global reference.
This effectively clears the parent&#8217;s transformation from the children. For example,
if the parent is moved 10 units along the X axis and <em>Clear Parent Inverse</em> is invoked,
any selected children are freed and moved -10 units back along the X axis.
The &#8220;Inverse&#8221; only uses the last transformation; if the parent moved twice,
10 units each time for a total of 20 units, then the &#8220;Inverse&#8221; will only move the child back 10 units, not 20.</dd>
