渲染 layers allow you to render your scene in separate layers,
usually with the intension of compositing them back together afterwards.

This can be useful for several purposes, such as color correcting certain elements differently,
blurring the foreground as a fast manual method of creating DoF,
or reducing the render quality for unimportant objects.

Using 渲染 Layers can also save you from having to re-render your entire image each time you change something,
allowing you to instead re-render only the layer(s) that you need.


Layer List
==========

This is a list of all the 渲染 Layers in the current scene.

Only layers which are enabled (checkbox on right is ticked) will be rendered.
If the *Pin* icon at the bottom right of the list is enabled, only the active (highlighted) layer will be rendered.

渲染 Layers can be added and removed using the ``+`` and ``-`` buttons on the right,
and existing layers can be renamed by double clicking on their name.


Layer Panel
===========

The Layer Panel shows the settings of the active 渲染 Layer from the list above.

You can select multiple layers using :kbd:`Shift-LMB`.

Scene
   The Scene Layers, showing which are currently visible and will be rendered.
Layer
   The Scene Layers which are associated with the active 渲染 Layer.
   Objects in those Scene Layers will be rendered in that 渲染 Layer.
   When an object is in the Scene Layers but not the 渲染 Layer,
   it will still cast shadows and be visible in reflections, so it is still indirectly visible.
Mask Layer
   Objects on these will mask out other objects appearing behind them.
Material Override
   Overrides all material settings to use the Material chosen here.

   例子s of where this might be used:

   - To check lighting by using a plain diffuse material on all objects
   - 渲染 a wireframe of the scene
   - Create a custom render pass such as an anti-aliased matte or global coordinates.

.. seealso::

   Additional options shown in this panel are different for each render engine. See these options for:

   - :doc:`Blender 渲染 </render/blender_render/layers>`
   - :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/settings/passes>`


Using 渲染 Layers
===================

Each 渲染 Layer has an associated set of :doc:`Scene Layers </editors/3dview/layers>`.
Objects which are on one of the associated Scene Layers are shown in that 渲染 Layer,
as long as that Scene Layer is also visible.


.. warning::

   Only the objects in visible Scene Layers will be rendered.
   So, if only Scene Layer 1 is visible and your 渲染 Layer set specifies to render only Layers 2 and 3,
   nothing will be rendered.
