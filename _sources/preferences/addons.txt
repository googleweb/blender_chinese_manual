插件
*******

The 插件 tab lets you manage secondary options which are not enabled in Blender by default.
New features may be added with *Install 插件*.
There will be a growing number of such 插件,
generated by the Blender-community so look out for that one feature you were missing
(or maybe simply create it yourself).

See the :doc:`插件 Page </advanced/scripting/python/addons>` for more on using 插件.
