配置
=========

Now that you have opened the 用户首选项 editor, you can configure Blender to your liking.
At the top of the editor, the available options are grouped into seven tabs:

:doc:`界面 </preferences/interface>`
   Change how UI elements are displayed and how they react.
:doc:`Editing </preferences/editing>`
   Control how several tools will interact with your input.
:doc:`Input </preferences/input>`
   Customize how Blender reacts to the mouse and keyboard as well as define your own keymap.
:doc:`Add-ons </preferences/addons>`
   Manage Blender's *Add-ons*, allowing you to access features
   not built-in as well as install new features.
:doc:`Themes </preferences/themes>`
   Customize interface appearance and colors.
:doc:`File </preferences/file>`
   配置 auto-save preferences and set default file paths for blend-files, rendered images, and more.
:doc:`System </preferences/system>`
   Set resolution, scripting console preferences, sound, graphics cards, and internationalization.


保存新的设置
========================

Once you have set your preferences, you will need to manually save them,
otherwise the new configuration will be lost after a restart.
Blender saves its preferences to *userpref.blend* in your user folder
(see next section, "恢复出厂设置", for details).

In the *用户首选项* editor, click on the *Save User 设置* button in the bottom left.
This will save all of the new preferences.


.. _factory-settings:

恢复出厂设置
=====================

Go to :menuselection:`File --> 恢复出厂设置`
then save the preferences via the *用户首选项* editor.

.. hint::

   It can be valuable to make a backup of your preferences the event that you lose your configuration.

   See the :doc:`directory layout </getting_started/installing/configuration/directories>`
   section to see where your preferences are stored.


.. _startup-file:

启动文件
============

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`File --> Save 启动文件`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-U`


When you start Blender or start a new project with the menu entry :menuselection:`File --> New`,
a new scene is created from the default scene included with Blender.

This default scene can instead be your own customized setup.

To change the default scene, make all of the desired changes to the current scene or current
file and :menuselection:`File --> Save 启动文件`.
