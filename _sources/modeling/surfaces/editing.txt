Surface editing has even fewer tools and options than its curve counterpart - and has many
common points with it... So this page covers (or tries to cover) all the subjects,
from the basics of surface editing to more advanced topics, like retopology.


移动, 旋转, 缩放
----------------------------

   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> 变换 --> Grab/Move, Rotate, Scale, ...`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`G`, :kbd:`R`, :kbd:`S`


Once you have a selection of one or more control points,
you can grab/move :kbd:`G`, rotate :kbd:`R` or scale :kbd:`S` them, like many other things in Blender,
as described in the :doc:`Manipulation in 3D Space </editors/3dview/transform/introduction>` section.

You also have in *编辑模式* an extra option when using these basic manipulations: the
:doc:`proportional editing </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/proportional_edit>`.


高级变换工具
------------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> 变换`


The *To Sphere*, *Shear*, *Warp* and *Push/Pull* transform tools are described in the
:doc:`Mesh Deforming </modeling/meshes/editing/deforming/index>` section.
曲面 have no specific transform tools.


NURBS Control Points 设置
-----------------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 面板:     Curve Tools (编辑模式) and 变换 Properties


We saw in a :ref:`previous page <modeling-surfaces-weight>` that NURBS control points have a weight,
which is the influence of this point on the surface.
You set it either using the big *Set Weight* button in the *Curve Tools* panel
(after having defined the weight in the numeric field to the right),
or by directly typing a value in the *W* numeric field of the *变换 Properties* panel.


Adding or Extruding
-------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> Extrude`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`E`, :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`


Unlike meshes or curves, you cannot generally directly add new control points to a surface
(with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` clicks), as you can only extend a surface by adding a whole U- or V-row at once.
The only exception is when working on a NURBS surface curve, i.e.
a surface with only one control point on each U- or V-row. In this special case,
all works exactly as with :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-extending>`.

Most of the time, only extrusion is available. As usual, once the tool is activated the
extrusion happens immediately and you are placed into *Grab mode*,
ready to drag the new extruded surface to its destination.

There are two things very important to understand:

- 曲面 are *2D* objects - so you cannot extrude anything *inside* a surface
  (e.g. "inner" row); it wouldn't make any sense!
- The control "grid" *must* remain "squarish",
  which means that you can only extrude a whole row, not parts of rows here and there...

To summarize, the *Extrude* tool will only work when one and only one whole border
row is selected - otherwise nothing happens.

As for curves, you cannot create a new surface in your object out of nowhere,
by just :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` - clicking with nothing selected.
However, unlike for curves, there is no "cut" option allowing you to separate a surface into several parts,
so you only can create a new surface by copying (`复制`_) an existing one
:kbd:`Shift-D`, or adding a new one with the *Add* menu.


例子
^^^^^^^^

图像s Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-edit-select-control` to Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-edit-select-complete`
show a typical extrusion along the side of a surface.

In Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-edit-select-control` and :kbd:`Shift-R`,
a border row of control points were highlighted by selecting a single control point,
labeled "C", and then using the handy row select tool :kbd:`Shift-R`
to select the rest of the control points.

.. _fig-surface-edit-select-control:

.. figure:: /images/nurbssurfaceselectedge.jpg
   :width: 500px

   选择 control-point.

The edge is then extruded using :kbd:`E` as shown in Fig. Extruding.
Notice how the mesh has bunched up next to the highlighted edge;
the area in question is highlighted in a light-gray circular area.
That is because the *new* extruded surface section is bunched up there as well.

.. _fig-surface-edit-select-complete:

.. figure:: /images/nurbsextrude.jpg
   :width: 500px

   Compete.

By moving the new section away from the area, the surface begins to "unbunch".
The direction of movement is marked with a white arrow, labeled "E",
and the new section is labeled "S".

You can continue this process of extruding - or adding - new surface sections until you have
reached the final shape for your model.


Opening or Closing a Surface
----------------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> Toggle Cyclic`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`C`


As in :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-opening-and-closing>`,
surfaces can be closed (cyclic) or open. However, as surfaces are 2D,
you can control this property independently along the U and V axes.

To toggle the cyclic property of a surface along one axis,
use :kbd:`Alt-C` and choose either *cyclic U* or *cyclic V* from the pop-up menu.
The corresponding surface's outer edges will join together to form a "closed" surface.

.. note:: Inner and Outer

   曲面 have an "inner" and "outer" face, the first being black whereas the latter is correctly shaded -
   there does not seem to be any "double sided" shading option for surfaces...).
   When you close a surface in one or two directions, you might get an entirely black object! In this case,
   just `切换方向`_ of your surface...


复制
-----------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Curve --> Duplicate`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`Shift-D`


Well, as with meshes and curves, this command just duplicates the selection. As usual,
the copy is selected and placed in *Grab* mode, so you can move it to another place.

However, with surfaces there are some selections that cannot be duplicated,
in which case they will just be placed in *Grab* mode... In fact,
only selections forming a *single* valid sub-grid are copyable; let us see this in practice:

- You can copy a single control point.
  From it, you will be able to "extrude" a "surface curve" along the U axis,
  and then extrude this unique U-row along the V axis to create a real new surface.
- You can copy a single continuous part of a row (or a whole row, of course).
  This will give you a new *U-row*, even if you selected (part of) a V-row!
- You can copy a single whole sub-grid.

.. note::

   Trying to duplicate several valid "sub-grids" (even being single points)
   at once won't work; you will have to do it one after the other...


删除元素
-----------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Curve --> Delete...`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`X`, :kbd:`Del`


The *Erase* pop-up menu of surfaces offers you two options:

Selected
   This will delete the selected rows, *without* breaking the surface
   (i.e. the adjacent rows will be directly linked, joined, once the intermediary ones are deleted).
   The selection must abide by the following rules:

   - Whole rows, and only whole rows must be selected.
   - Only rows along the same axis must be selected (i.e. you cannot delete both U- and V-rows at the same time).

   Also remember that NURBS order cannot be higher than its number of control points in a given axis,
   so it might decrease when you delete some control points...
   Of course, when only one row remains, the surface becomes a "surface curve"; when only one point remains,
   there is no more visible surface; and when all points are deleted, the surface itself is deleted.

All
   As with meshes or curves, this deletes everything in the object!


例子
^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/nurbsdeletingsegments.jpg
   :width: 600px

   Before and after.


In Fig. Before a row of control points has been selected by initially selecting the control point labeled "A"
and using :kbd:`Shift-R` to select the remaining control points.
Then, using the *Delete Menu* :kbd:`X`,
the *selected* row of control points is erased, resulting in Fig. After.


Joining or Merging 曲面
---------------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> 创建段`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`F`

Just like :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-joining-segments>`,
merging two surfaces requires that a single edge, a border row of control points,
from two separate surfaces are selected. This means that the surfaces must be part of the same object. For example,
you cannot join two surfaces while in *物体模式* - but you can of course, as with any objects of the same type,
join two or more *Surface* objects
into one object :kbd:`Ctrl-J` - they just won't be "linked" or merged in a single one... Yes, it's a bit confusing!

This command is equivalent to creating edges or :kbd:`F` aces for meshes
(hence its shortcut), and so it only works in *编辑模式*.
The selection must contains only border rows of the same resolution
(with the same number of control points),
else Blender will try to do its best to guess what to merge with what, or the merge will fail
(either silently, or stating that ``Resolution doesn't match`` if rows with
different number of points are selected, or that there is ``Too few selections to merge``
if you only selected points in one surface...).
To select control points of different surfaces,
in the same object, you must use either border select or circle select.
Holding down :kbd:`Ctrl` while :kbd:`LMB` will not work.

So to avoid problems, you should always only select border rows with the same number of
points... Note that you can join a border U-row of one surface with a border V-row of another
one, Blender will automatically "invert" the axis of one surface for them to match correctly.

NURBS surface curves are often used to create objects like hulls,
as they define cross sections all along the object,
and you just have to "skin" them as described above to get a nice, smooth and harmonious shape.


例子
^^^^^^^^

Fig. Joining ready is an example of two NURBS surface curves, **not** NURBS曲线,
in *编辑模式*, ready to be joined.
Fig. Joining complete is the result of joining the two curves.


.. figure:: /images/nurbsjoin.jpg
   :width: 350px

   Joining ready and Joining complete.


细分
-----------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 面板:    Curve Tools
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`SurfaceTools --> 建模 --> Subdivide`, :menuselection:`Specials --> Subdivide`


Surface subdivision is most simple:
using either the *Subdivide* entry in the *Specials* menu
:kbd:`W`, or the *Subdivide* button of the *Curve Tools1* panel,
you will subdivide once all *completely* selected grids by subdividing each "quad" into four
smaller ones.

If you apply it to a 1D surface (a "surface curve"),
this tool works exactly as with :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-subdivision>`.


Spin
----


.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 面板:    Curve Tools


This tool is a bit similar to its :doc:`mesh counterpart </modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/spin>` -
but with less control and options (in fact, there's none!).

It only works on selected "surfaces" made of *one U-row* (and not with one V-row),
so-called "surface curves", by "extruding" this "cross section" in a square pattern,
automatically adjusting the weights of control points to get a perfect circular extrusion
(this also implies closing the surface along the V axis), following exactly the same principle
as for the *NURBS Tube* or *NURBS Donut* primitives.


切换方向
----------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Surface --> Segments --> 切换方向`,
     :menuselection:`Specials --> 切换方向`


This command will "reverse" the direction of any curve with at least one selected element 
(i.e. the start point will become the end one, and *vice versa*).
Mainly useful when using a curve as path, or the bevel and taper options...


其他 Specials Options
----------------------

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     Specials
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`W`


The *Specials* menu contains exactly the same additional options as for
curves, except for *Set Radius* and *Smooth Radius*.


Conversion
----------

As there are only NURBS surfaces, there is no "internal" conversion here.

However, there is an "external" conversion available, from surface to mesh,
that only works in *物体模式*.
It transforms a *Surface* object into a *Mesh* one,
using the surface resolutions in both directions to create faces, edges and vertices.


Misc 编辑
------------

You have some of the same options as with meshes, or in *物体模式*.
You can :ref:`separate <object-separate>` a given surface :kbd:`P`,
make other selected objects :ref:`children <object-parenting>`
of one or three control points
:kbd:`Ctrl-P`,
or :doc:`add hooks </modeling/modifiers/deform/hooks>` to control some points with other objects.

The *镜像* tool is also available, behaving exactly as with
:doc:`mesh vertices </modeling/meshes/editing/basics/mirror>`.
