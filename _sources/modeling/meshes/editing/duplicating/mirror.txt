镜像ing an Object or Mesh selection will create a reversed version of the selection. The
position of the mirrored version of the selection is determined by the
:doc:`轴心点 </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>`.
A common use of mirroring is to model half an object, duplicate it and then use the
mirror transform to create a reversed version to complete the model.


.. note::

   镜像ed duplicates can also be created with a :doc:`镜像 Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>`.

   镜像ing a selection.


用法
=====

To mirror a selection along a particular global axis press:
:kbd:`Ctrl-M`, followed by :kbd:`X`, :kbd:`Y` or :kbd:`Z`.
The image *镜像ing a selection* shows the results of this action after a mesh
element has been duplicated.

In Mesh mode, you can mirror the selection on the currently selected
:doc:`变换 Orientations </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/transform_orientations>`
by pressing the appropriate axis key a second time. For example,
if the 变换 Orientation is set to *Normal*, pressing:
:kbd:`Ctrl-M`, followed by :kbd:`X` and then :kbd:`X` again
will mirror the selection along the X-axis of the *Normal Orientation.*

   Interactive mirror.

You can alternatively hold the :kbd:`MMB` to interactively mirror the object by moving
the mouse in the direction of the mirror axis.
