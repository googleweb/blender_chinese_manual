This tool takes the currently selected faces and creates an inset of them,
with adjustable thickness and depth. The tool is modal, such that when you activate it,
you may adjust the thickness with your mouse position. You may also adjust the depth of the
inset during the modal operation by holding :kbd:`Ctrl`.
