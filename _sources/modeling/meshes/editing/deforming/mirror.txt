   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Mirror --> Desired Axis`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-M`


The mirror tool mirrors a selection across a selected axis.

The mirror tool in *编辑模式* is similar to
:doc:`Mirroring in 物体模式 </modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/mirror>`.
It is exactly equivalent to scaling by -1 vertices,
edges or faces around one chosen 轴心点 and in the direction of one chosen axis, only it is faster/handier.


After this tool becomes active, select an axis to mirror the selection on entering x,y, or z.

You can also interactively mirror the geometry by holding the :kbd:`MMB` and dragging in
the direction of the desired mirror direction.


Axis of symmetry
================

For each transformation orientation,
you can choose one of its axes along which the mirroring will occur.

As you can see, the possibilities are infinite and the freedom complete:
you can position the 轴心点 at any location around which we want the mirroring to occur,
choose one transformation orientation and then one axis on it.


Pivot point
===========

:doc:`Pivot points </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>` must be set first.
Pivot points will become the center of symmetry.
If the widget is turned on it will always show where the 轴心点 is.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-deform-mirror-center` the 轴心点 default to
median point of the selection of vertices in *编辑模式*.
This is a special case of the *编辑模式* as explained on the
:doc:`轴心点 page </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>`.

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-deform-mirror-cursor` the 轴心点 is the *3D游标*,
the transformation orientation is *Local*, a.k.a. the Object space,
and the axis of transformation is X.

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis using the 3D游标 as a 轴心点.


变换ation orientation
==========================

:doc:`变换ation Orientations </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/transform_orientations>`
are found on the 3D area header, next to the *Widget* buttons.
They decide which coordinate system will rule the mirroring.
