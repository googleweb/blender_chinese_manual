Mesh analysis is useful for displaying attributes of the mesh that may impact certain use
cases.

The mesh analysis works in editmode and shows areas with a high value in red,
and areas with a low value in blue.
几何体 outside the range is displayed grey.

Currently the different modes target 3D-printing as their primary use.


悬垂
========

   悬垂.


Extrusion 3D printers have a physical limit to the overhang that can be printed,
this display mode shows the overhang with angle range and axis selection.


厚度
=========

.. figure:: /images/editmode_mesh_statvis_thick.jpg
   :height: 260px

   厚度.


Printers have a limited *wall-thickness* where very thin areas cannot be printed,
this test uses ray casting and a distance range to the thickness of the geometry.


交集
=============

.. figure:: /images/editmode_mesh_statvis_intersect.jpg
   :height: 260px

   Intersecting faces.


Another common cause of problems for printing are intersections between surfaces,
where the inside/outside of a model cannot be reliably detected.

Unlike other display modes, intersections have no variance and are either on or off.


畸变
==========

.. figure:: /images/editmode_mesh_statvis_distort.jpg
   :height: 260px

   Distorted Faces.


Distorted geometry can cause problems since the triangulation of a distorted ngon is undefined.

畸变 is measured by faces which are not flat,
with parts of the face pointing in different directions.


锐利
===========

.. figure:: /images/editmode_mesh_statvis_sharp.jpg
   :height: 260px

   Sharp edges.


Similar to wall-thickness, sharp edges can form shapes that are too thin to be able to print.

.. warning::

   There are some known limitations with mesh analysis

   - Currently only displayed with deform modifiers.
   - For high-poly meshes is slow to use while editing the mesh.
