Curve selection in *编辑模式* is much less complex than with meshes! Mainly this is
because you have only one selectable element type, the control points
(no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit more complex than simple vertices,
however, especially for 贝塞尔s, as there is the central vertex, and its two handles...

The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes </modeling/meshes/selecting/basics>`,
so you can select a simple control point with a :kbd:`RMB`,
add to current selection with :kbd:`Shift-RMB`, :kbd:`B` border-select, and so on.

One word about the 贝塞尔 control points: when you select the main central vertex,
the two handles are automatically selected too, so you can grab it as a whole,
without creating an angle in the curve. However, when you select a handle,
only this vertex is selected, allowing you to modify this control vector...

:kbd:`L` (or :kbd:`Ctrl-L`) will add to the selection the cursor's nearest control point, and all the linked ones,
i.e. all points belonging to the same curve. Note that for 贝塞尔,
using :kbd:`L` with a handle selected will select the whole control point and all the linked ones.


选择菜单
===========

With curves, all "advanced" selection options are regrouped in the *Select* menu of
the 3D视图s header. Let us detail them.

- *Random...*
- *Inverse*
- *Select/Deselect All*

Border Select
   All these options have the same meaning and behavior as in :doc:`物体模式 </editors/3dview/selecting>`
   (and the specifics of *Border Select* in *编辑模式* have already been discussed
   :doc:`here </modeling/meshes/selecting/introduction>`).

间隔式弃选
================

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Select --> 间隔式弃选`
   | 快捷键:   None


This only works if you already have at least one control point selected.
Using the current selection, it will add to it every nth control point,
before and after the initial selection. The "selection step" is specified in the *N*
pop-up numeric field shown during the tool start.

Nth Selection
   Number of points to select.
Skip
   Number of points to skip.
偏移量
   Offests at what point to start at.


选中/弃选首点/末点
==========================

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Select --> Select/Deselect First`, :menuselection:`Select --> Select/Deselect Last`
   | 快捷键:   None


These commands will toggle the selection of the first or last control point(s) of the curve(s)
in the object. This is useful to quickly find the start of a curve (e.g.
when using it as path...).


选择下一项 /上一项
====================

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Select --> Select 下一页`, :menuselection:`Select --> Select 上一页`
   | 快捷键:   None


These commands will select the next or previous control point(s),
based on the current selection (i.e.
the control points following or preceding the selected ones along the curve).


扩展/缩减 选择
================

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Select --> More/Less`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadPlus`/:kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadMinus`


Their purpose, based on the currently selected control points, is to reduce or enlarge this selection.

More
   for each selected control point, select *all* its linked points (i.e. one or two...).
Less
   for each selected control point, if *all* points linked to this point are selected, keep this one selected.
   其他wise, de-select it.

This implies two points:

- First, when *all* control points of a curve are selected, nothing will happen (as for *Less*,
  all linked points are always selected, and of course, *More* cannot add any).
  Conversely, the same goes when no control points are selected.
- Second, these tools will never "go outside" of a curve
  (they will never "jump" to another curve in the same object).
