简介

A UV 纹理 is a picture (image, sequence or movie)
that is used to color the surface of a mesh.
The UV 纹理 is mapped to the mesh through one or more UV maps.
There are three ways to establish the image used by the UV 纹理:


- Paint a flat image in the UV/图像编辑器 onto the currently selected UV 纹理,
  using its UV map to transfer the colors to the faces of the mesh.
- Paint the mesh in the 3D视图, and let Blender use the currently selected UV map to update the UV 纹理
  (see :ref:`Projection 绘制 <painting_texture-index>`).
- Use any image-editing (paint) program to create an image.
  In the UV/图像编辑器, select the UV 纹理 and load the image.
  Blender will then use that texture's UV map to transfer the colors to the faces of the mesh

Blender features a built-in paint mode called 纹理 Paint which is designed specifically to
help you edit your UV 纹理 and images quickly and 
easily in either the UV/图像 or the 3D视图 Editor. 
Since a UV 纹理 is just a special-purpose image,
you can also use any external paint program. For example,
GIMP is a full-featured image manipulation program that is also open-source.

Since a mesh can have layers of UV 纹理, there may be many images that color the mesh.
However, each UV 纹理 only has one image.

纹理 Paint works in both a 3D视图 and the UV/图像编辑器.
In the 3D视图 in 纹理绘制模式, you paint directly on the mesh by
:ref:`projecting onto the UVs <painting_texture-index>`.


入门指南
===============

Once you have unwrapped your model to a UV Map (as explained in previous pages),
you can begin the texturing process.
You cannot paint on a mesh in 纹理绘制模式 without **first** unwrapping your mesh,
**and** doing one of the following steps. Either:

See: :doc:`Applyin 图像 </editors/uv_image/uv_editing/applying_image>`.

After you have done one of these two things,
you can modify the image using the 纹理绘制模式:


.. figure:: /images/texture-painting-paintmode.jpg
   :width: 250px

   Enabling paint mode.


- In the 3D视图, select 纹理绘制模式 from the mode selector in the header,
  and you can paint directly onto the mesh.
- In the UV/图像编辑器, switch the mode from View to Paint (shown to the right).


.. note:: Square Power of 2

   纹理 paint is very fast and responsive when working in the 3D视图 and when your image is sized as a
   square where the side lengths are a power of two, e.g. 256×256, 512×512, 1024×1024, etc.


Once you enable 纹理 绘制, your mouse becomes a brush. To work with the UV layout
(for example, to move coordinates) you must go back to "View" mode.

As soon as you enable 纹理 绘制 or switch to 纹理绘制模式,
brush settings become available in the Tool Shelf :kbd:`T`.

In the UV/图像编辑器,
you paint on a flat canvas that is wrapped around the mesh using UV coordinates.
Any changes made in the UV/图像编辑器 show up immediately in the 3D视图,
and vice versa.

A full complement of brushes and colors can be selected from 
the Properties panel in the UV/图像编辑器.
Brush changes made in either panel are immediately reflected in the other panel. However,
the modified texture will **not** be saved automatically;
you must explicitly do so by :menuselection`图像 --> Save` in the UV/图像编辑器.


纹理 Preview
===============

If your texture is already used to color, bump map, displace, alpha-transparent, etc.,
a surface of a model in your scene (in other technical words,
is mapped to some aspect of a texture via a texture channel using UV as a map input),
you can see the effects of your painting in the context of your scene as you paint.

To do this, set up side-by-side windows, one window in 3D视图 set to *纹理* shading option,
and in the second window the UV/图像编辑器 loaded with your image.
Position the 3D视图 to show the object that is UV mapped to the loaded image.
In the image to the right, the texture being painted is mapped to the "Normal" attribute,
and is called "bump mapping",
where the gray-scale image is used to make the flat surface appear bumpy.
See 纹理 Mapping Output for more information on bump mapping.


保存
======

If the header menu item 图像 has an asterisk next to it,
it means that the image has been changed, but not saved. 
Use the :menuselection`图像 --> Save 图像`
option to save your work with a different name or overwrite the original image.

.. note:: UV 纹理

   Since images used as UV 纹理 are functionally different from other images,
   you should keep them in a directory separate from other images.


The image format for saving is independent of the format for rendering.
The format for saving a UV image is selected in the header of the File browser,
and defaults to ``PNG`` (``.png``).

If Packing is enabled in the File browsers header, 
or if you manually :menuselection`图像 --> Pack 图像`,
saving your images to a separate file is not necessary.


Using an External 图像编辑器
==============================

If you use an external program to edit your UV 纹理, you must:

- run that paint program (GIMP, Photoshop\ :sup:`®` \, etc.)
- load the image or create a new one
- change the image, and
- re-save it within that program.
- Back in Blender, you reload the image in the UV/图像编辑器.

You want to use an external program if you have teams of people using different programs that
are developing the UV textures,
or if you want to apply any special effects that 纹理 Paint does not feature,
or if you are much more familiar with your favorite paint program.


Known Limitations
=================

UV Overlap
----------

In general overlapping UVs are not supported (as with texture baking).

However, this is only a problem when a single brush stroke paints onto multiple faces that share a texture.


Perspective View & Faces Behind the View
----------------------------------------

When painting onto a face which is partially behind the view (in perspective mode), the face cannot be painted on.
To avoid, this zoom out or use an Ortho mode viewport.


Perspective View & Low Poly
---------------------------

When painting onto a face in perspective mode onto a low poly object with normals pointing away from the view,
painting may fail; to workaround disable the *Normal* option in the paint panel.

Typically this happens when painting onto the side of a cube 
(see `Bug report T34665 <https://developer.blender.org/T34665>`__).
