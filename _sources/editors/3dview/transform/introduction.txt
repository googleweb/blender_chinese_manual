变换ations refer to a number of operations that can be performed on a
selected Object or Mesh that alters its position or characteristics.

Each object can be moved, rotated and scaled in *物体模式*.
However, not all of these transformations have an effect on all objects.
For example, scaling a camera has no effect on the render dimensions.

Basic transformations include:

- :doc:`Grabbing (moving) </editors/3dview/transform/basics/grab>`
- :doc:`Rotating </editors/3dview/transform/basics/rotate>`
- :doc:`Scaling </editors/3dview/transform/basics/scale>`

These three transforms are the three big ones however, more, advanced transformations can be found in the
:doc:`高级应用 变换ations </editors/3dview/transform/index>` section.

For making other changes to the geometry of editable objects,
you should use *编辑模式*.

Once you have added a basic object, you remain in *物体模式*.

You can switch between *物体模式* and *编辑模式* by pressing :kbd:`Tab`.

The object's wireframe should now appear orange. This means that the object is now selected and active.

The Fig. Selected object image shows both the solid view and wireframe view of the default cube.
To switch between wireframe and solid view, press :kbd:`Z`.
