In 物体模式
==============

   Rotation around individual origins.


The Origin of an object is shown in the 3D视图 by a small orange circle.
This is highlighted in the image to the right by the red arrow.
The origin tells Blender the relative position of that object in 3D space. What you see in the 3D视图
(vertices, edges etc) is what makes up the object.

While the Origin is equivalent to the center of the object,
it does not have to be located in the center of the *Mesh*. This means that an object can
have its center located on one end of the mesh or even completely outside the mesh.
For example,
the orange rectangle in the image has its Origin located on the far left of the mesh.

Now let us examine: Rotation around the individual origins.

- The blue rectangle has its Origin located in the center of the mesh,
  while the orange rectangle has its Origin located on the left hand side.
- When the 轴心点 is set to *各自的原心*,
  the center of each object (indicated by the red arrow)
  remains in place while the object rotates around it in the path shown by the black arrow.


In 编辑模式
============

In 编辑模式, setting the 轴心点 to 各自的原心 produces different results when
the selection mode is set to Vertex, Edge or Face. For example, Vertex mode produces results
similar to setting the 轴心点 to median and Edge mode often produces distorted results.
Using 各自的原心 in Face mode produces the most predictable results.

          Rotation of individual faces with the 轴心点 indicated by the image text.

          :width: 320px

          Rotation of grouped faces with the 轴心点 indicated by the image text.


As can be seen in the images above, faces that touch each other will deform when rotated when
the 轴心点 is set to 各自的原心.
Faces that do not touch will rotate around their 各自的原心 (their center).

          Scaling with non-touching faces.

          :width: 320px

          Scaling with touching faces.


Groups of faces and Fgons can be scaled without their outside perimeter being deformed.
However, the individual faces inside will not be scaled uniformly.

   建模 with faces and individual origins as the 轴心点.


Once you are aware of its limitations and pitfalls,
this tool can save a lot of time and lead to unique shapes. This "anemone" was modeled from a
12 sided cylinder in about 10 minutes by repeatedly using this workflow:
extrusions of individual faces, scaling with *median as a 轴心点*,
and scaling and rotations of those faces with *各自的原心 as 轴心点s*.
