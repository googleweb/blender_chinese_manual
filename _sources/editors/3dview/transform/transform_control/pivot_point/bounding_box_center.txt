The bounding box is a rectangular box that is wrapped as tightly as possible around the selection.
It is oriented parallel to the world axes. In this mode the 轴心点 lies at the center of the bounding box.
You can set the 轴心点 to bounding box with :kbd:`,` or via the menu in the editors header.
The image below shows how the Object's Bounding Box size is determined by the size of the Object.

   Relationship between an Object and its Bounding Box.


In 物体模式
==============

In *物体模式*, the bounding box is wrapped around the Object and transformation
takes place relative to the location of the Object center (indicated by the yellow circle).
The image below shows the results of using the Bounding Box as the 轴心点 in a number of
situations.

For example, images A (before rotation)
and B show rotation when the Object center is in its default position, while images C
(before rotation) and D shows the result when the Object center has been moved.
图像 E shows that when multiple Objects are selected,
the 轴心点 is calculated based on the Bounding Box of all the selected Objects.

   The grid of four images on the left (ABCD) shows the results of Object rotation
   when the 轴心点 is set to Bounding Box.
   The image to the right (E) shows the location of the Bounding Box 轴心点 when multiple Objects are selected.
   The 轴心点 is shown by a yellow circle.


In 编辑模式
============

This time it is the ObData that is enclosed in the bounding box.
The bounding box in *编辑模式* takes no account of the Object(s) centers,
only the center of the selected vertices.

   The 轴心点 is shown by a yellow circle.
