The *active* element can be an Object, vertex, edge or a face. The active element is the
last one to be selected and will be shown in a lighter orange color when in *物体模式*
and white when in *编辑模式*. With *Active element as Pivot* set to active,
all transformations will occur relative to the active element.

   Display of active elements in 物体模式 is shown on the left of the
   image where the active element (cube) is a lighter orange.
   Active elements for vertices, edges and faces in 编辑模式 are displayed in white and are shown on the right.


In 物体模式
==============

When in *物体模式*,
rotation and scaling happen around the active Object's center.
This is shown by the figure to the below where the active Object (the cube)
remains in the same location (note its position relative to the 3D游标)
while the other Objects rotate and scale in relation to the active element.

   Rotation and scaling with the cube as the active element.


In 编辑模式
============

Using the active element as a 轴心点 in *编辑模式* may seem complex but all
the possible transformations follow a few rules:


- The 轴心点 is always at the median of the active element(s).
- The transformations occur by transformation of the *vertices* of the selected element(s).
  If an unselected element shares one or more vertices with a selected element
  then the unselected one will get some degree of transformation also.

Let us examine the following examples: in each case we will see that the two rules apply.


单选
----------------

When one single element is selected it becomes automatically active. In the image below,
you can see that when it is transformed its vertices move, with the consequence that any
adjacent element which shares one or more vertices with the active element is also
transformed.

   编辑模式 and only one element selected.


Let us review each case:

- *Faces* have their 轴心点 where their selection dot appears, which is where the median of their vertices is.
- *Edges* have their 轴心点 on their middle since this is always where the median of an edge is.
- A single *Vertex* has no dimensions at all so it cannot show any transformation
  (except translation, which is not affected by the 轴心点).


多选
------------------

When multiple elements are selected they all transform.
The 轴心点s stay in the same place as what we have seen above,
with only one exception for Fgons. In the image below,
the selected elements have been rotated.

   编辑模式 and multiple selections.


- For *Faces* the transformation occurs around the selection dot of the active face.
- *Edges* also keep the same behavior with their 轴心点 at their median.
- *Fgons* behave exactly like faces.
- There is a case for *Vertices* this time: the active Vertex is where the 轴心点 resides.
  All other vertices are transformed relative to it.
