*****************
比例化编辑
*****************

比例化编辑 is a way of transforming selected elements (such as vertices)
while having that transformation affect other nearby elements. For example, having the
movement of a single vertex cause the movement of unselected vertices within a given range.
Unselected vertices that are closer to the selected vertex will move more than those farther
from it (i.e. they will move proportionally relative to the location of the selected element).
Since proportional editing affects the nearby geometry,
it is very useful when you need to smoothly deform the surface of a dense mesh.

.. note:: 雕刻

   Blender also has :ref:`painting_sculping-index`
   that contains brushes and tools for proportionally editing a mesh without seeing the individual vertices.


物体模式
===========

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     物体模式
   | 菜单:     Via the |prop-edit-icon| icon in the header indicated by the yellow square in the below image.
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`O`


Proportional editing is typically used in *编辑模式*, however,
it can also be used in *物体模式*. In *物体模式* the tool works on
entire objects rather than individual mesh components. In the image below,
the green cube is the active Object, while the red and blue cubes are located within the
proportional edit tool's radius of influence. When the green cube is moved to the right,
the other two cubes follow the movement.

编辑模式
=========

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 模式:     编辑模式
   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Proportional 编辑` and via the |prop-edit-edit-mode-icon| highlighted icon
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`O`, :kbd:`Alt-O`, :kbd:`Shift-O`


When working with dense geometry, it can become difficult to make subtle adjustments to the
vertices without causing visible lumps and creases in the model's surface. When you face
situations like this the proportional editing tool can be used to smoothly deform the surface
of the model.
This is done by the tool's automatic modification of unselected vertices within a given range.

Influence
---------

You can increase or decrease the radius of the proportional editing influence with the mouse
wheel :kbd:`WheelUp`, :kbd:`WheelDown` or :kbd:`PageUp`, :kbd:`PageDown`
respectively. As you change the radius,
the points surrounding your selection will adjust their positions accordingly.

         Falloff menu.


The *Proportional 编辑* mode menu is on the *3D视图* header.

Disable :kbd:`O`, :kbd:`Alt-O`
   Proportional 编辑 is Off, only selected vertices will be affected.
Enable :kbd:`O`, :kbd:`Alt-O`
   Vertices other than the selected vertex are affected, within a defined radius.
Projected (2D)
   Depth along the view is ignored when applying the radius.

Connected :kbd:`Alt-O`
   Rather than using a radius only, the proportional falloff spreads via connected geometry. This means that you can
   proportionally edit the vertices in a finger of a hand without affecting the other fingers.
   While the other vertices are physically close (in 3D space),
   they are far away following the topological edge connections of the mesh.
   The icon will have a grey center when *Connected* is active.
   This mode is only available in *编辑模式*.


Falloff
   While editing, you can change the curve profile used by either using the
   :menuselection:`Mesh --> Proportional Falloff` submenu, using the header icon *Falloff menu*,
   or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-O` to toggle between the various options.

例子
--------

Switch to a front view :kbd:`Numpad1` and activate the grab tool with :kbd:`G`.
As you drag the point upwards, notice how nearby vertices are dragged along with it.
When you are satisfied with the placement, click :kbd:`LMB` to fix the position.
If you are not satisfied,
cancel the operation and revert your mesh to the way it looked before with 
:kbd:`RMB`, :kbd:`Esc`.

You can use the proportional editing tool to produce great effects with the scaling
:kbd:`S` and rotation :kbd:`R` tools,
as Fig. :ref:`fig-view3d-transform-landscape` shows.

Combine these techniques with vertex painting to create fantastic landscapes.
