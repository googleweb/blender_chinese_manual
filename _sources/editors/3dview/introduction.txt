************
简介
************

The 3D视图 is used to interact with the 3D scene for a variety of purposes, such as modeling, animation,
texture painting, etc.

.. TODO expand, more general info

Navigating in the 3D space is done with the use of both mouse movement and keyboard shortcuts.

Orbit :kbd:`MMB`
   Rotate the view around the point of interest.
Pan :kbd:`Shift-MMB`
   Move the view up, down, left and right
Zoom :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`, :kbd:`Wheel`
   Move the camera forwards and backwards

Modes
=====

Blender has a number of *Modes* used for editing different kinds of data:

- 物体模式
- 编辑模式
- 姿态模式
- 雕刻模式
- Vertex Paint
- Weight Paint
- 纹理 Paint
- Particle Edit

The mode can be changed using the menu in the 3D视图 header, or using the hotkey associated with that mode.

Regions of the 3D视图
======================

Toolshelf
---------

The Toolshelf is a context-sensitive region containing tools depending on the current mode
(for example, modeling tools in *编辑模式*, brush tools in *雕刻模式*...).

For more information on specific tools available, see:

Properties Region
-----------------

The Properties Region contains properties of the active object and selected objects (such as their locations),
as well as properties of the editor itself
(such as the :doc:`Display and View Panels </editors/3dview/display/panels>`
and :doc:`Background 图像s </editors/3dview/display/background_images>`).


Header
