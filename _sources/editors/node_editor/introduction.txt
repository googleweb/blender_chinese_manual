   The 节点编辑器.

The *节点编辑器* is used to work with node-based work flows.
The node tree type can be changed using the buttons in the node editor header.
However, here we will only give an overview of what the *节点编辑器* is.
In the list below it shows a list of different types of node trees and where each is documented.

Regions of the 节点编辑器
==========================

Toolshelf
---------

The *toolshelf* is a context-sensitive region, natively containing tools for the grease pencil and buttons for adding
nodes. The toolshelf is organized using tabs.

Properties Region
-----------------

The *properties region* contains properties for the current selected node as well as node editor specific settings.

Header
------

The *header* contains various menus, buttons and options, partially based on the current node tree type.
