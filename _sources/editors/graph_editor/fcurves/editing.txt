By default, when new channels are added, the *Graph Editor* sets them to *编辑模式*.
Selected channels can be locked by pressing :kbd:`Tab`.

Many of the hotkeys are the same as the viewport ones, for example:

- :kbd:`G` to grab
- :kbd:`R` to rotate
- :kbd:`S` to scale
- :kbd:`B` for border select/deselect

And of course you can lock the transformation along the X (time frame) or Y
(value) axises by pressing :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` during transformation.

For precise control of the keyframe position and value,
you can set values in the *Active Keyframe* of the Properties Region.


变换 吸附
==================

When transforming keyframes with :kbd:`G`, :kbd:`R`, :kbd:`S`,
the transformation can be snapped to increments.

Snap 变换ation to 1.0 :kbd:`Ctrl`

Divide 变换ation by 10.0 :kbd:`Shift`

Keyframes can be snapped to different properties by using the *Snap Keys* tool.

Snap Keys :kbd:`Shift-S`
   Current Frame
      Snap the selected keyframes to the *Time Cursor*.
   Cursor Value
      Snap the selected keyframes to the *Cursor*.
   Nearest Frame
      Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest frame individually.
   Nearest Second
      Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest second individually, based on the *FPS* of the scene.
   Nearest Marker
      Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest marker individually.
   Flatten Handles
      Flatten the *贝塞尔* handles for the selected keyframes.

镜像
======

Selected keyframes can be mirrored over different properties using the *镜像 Keys*
tool.

镜像 Keys :kbd:`Shift-M`
   By Times Over Current Frame
      镜像 horizontally over the *Time Cursor*.
   By Values over Cursor Value
      镜像 vertically over the *Cursor*.
   By Times over Time 0
      镜像 horizontally over frame 0.
   By Values over Value 0
      镜像 vertically over value 0.
   By Times over First Selected Marker
      镜像 horizontally the over the first selected *Marker*.


Clean Keyframes
===============

*Clean Keyframes* resets the keyframe tangents to their auto-clamped shape,
if they have been modified. *Clean Keyframes* :kbd:`O`

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/fcurve-clean1.jpg
          :width: 300px

          F-曲线 before cleaning.

平滑
=========

.. admonition:: 参考
   :class: refbox

   | 菜单:     :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth Keys`
   | 快捷键:   :kbd:`Alt-O`


There is also an option to smooth the selected curves , but beware: its algorithm seems to be
to divide by two the distance between each keyframe and the average linear value of the curve,
without any setting, which gives quite a strong smoothing! Note that the first and last keys
seem to be never modified by this tool.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/fcurve-clean1.jpg
          :width: 300px

Sampling and Baking Keyframes
=============================

Sample Keyframes :kbd:`Shift-O`
   Sampling a set a keyframes replaces interpolated values with a new keyframe for each frame.

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: /images/fcurve-sample.jpg
             :width: 300px

             F-曲线 after sampling.


Bake 曲线 :kbd:`Alt-C`
   Baking a curve replaces it with a set of sampled points, and removes the ability to edit the curve.


Bake Sound to F-曲线
======================

The *Bake Sound to F-曲线* tool takes and sound file and uses its sound wave to create the animation data.

Lowest frequency
   Cutoff frequency of a high-pass filter that is applied to the audio data.
Highest frequency
   Cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter that is applied to the audio data.
Attack time
   Value for the hull curve calcuclation that tells how fast the hull curve can rise.
   The lower the value the steeper it can rise.
Release time
   Value for the hull curve calculation that tells how fast the hull curve can fall.
   The lower the value the steeper it can fall.
Threshold
   Minimum amplitude value needed to influence the hull curve.

Accumulate
   Only the positive differences of the hull curve amplitudes are summarized to produce the output.
Additive
   The amplitudes of the hull curve are summarized. If *Accumulate* is enabled,
   both positive and negative differences are accumulated.
Square
   Gives the output as a square curve.
   Negative values always result in -1, and positive ones in 1.

   Square Threshold
      All values lower than this threshold result in 0.
