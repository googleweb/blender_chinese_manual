相机
******

The 游戏引擎 camera is in many ways similar to the 相机 in the normal Blender 渲染
system, and is created, parameterized and manipulated in similar ways.
However, because of its use as a real-time device, the 游戏引擎 camera has a number of
additional features - it may be used as not only as a static camera,
but also as a moving device with its default characteristics (ie.
with its own programmed moves), or it may track another object in the game. Furthermore,
any game object may be used as a camera; the view is taken from the object's origin point.
Lastly, it may be given special capabilities such as Stereo vision, Dome visualisation etc.
which have special relevance to game technology.

When you start the 游戏引擎, the initial camera view is taken from the latest 3D视图.
This may be either a selected camera object or the default camera (see below).
Thus to start the game with a particular camera,
you must select the camera and press :kbd:`Numpad0` before starting the 游戏引擎.


.. tip:: To avoid camera distortion

   Always zoom the view in until the camera object fills the entire viewport.


Default 相机
==============

The default camera view is taken from the latest 3D视图 view,
at a distance equivalent to the viewer. This means that if the normal 3D视图 is active the
scene does not change when the 游戏引擎 is started.


相机 Object
=============

The 相机 object in the 游戏引擎 follows much the same structure as the conventional Blender camera - see
:doc:`相机 </editors/3dview/object/types/camera/index>` for details of how to set up,
manipulate and select a camera. The following sections show some of the special facilities available in BGE cameras.


Parent 相机 to Object
=======================

The camera will follow the object. First select the camera and then select the object.
下一页 :kbd:`Ctrl-P` :menuselection:`--> Make Parent`.

Note that if your object has any rotations then the camera will also have those rotations.
To avoid this use `Parent to Vertex`_.


Parent to Vertex
================

The easiest way to accomplish this is to select your object and :kbd:`Tab` to
*编辑模式*.
Now select the vertex and :kbd:`Tab` back to *物体模式*.

下一页, without any objects selected, select the camera and, holding :kbd:`Shift`,
select the object. :kbd:`Tab` into *编辑模式*,
and :kbd:`Ctrl-P` and choose *Make vertex parent*.

Now the camera will follow the object and it will maintain its rotation,
while the object rotates.
