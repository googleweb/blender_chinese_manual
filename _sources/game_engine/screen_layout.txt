游戏逻辑屏幕布局
************************

The design, construction, debugging and running of a game utilizes a wide range of Blender functions.
To help with the process, Blender incorporates a suggested screen layout for setting up BGE games.
This includes many already-familiar panels but also a new
:doc:`逻辑编辑器 </editors/logic_editor>` panel (4) concerned solely with the BGE.

The diagram below shows this default Game 逻辑 screen layout,
together with the appropriate options for game setup/debug/running
(these should be set up in the order shown).

   Game 逻辑 Menu.


.. rubric:: 1) Game 逻辑

Selected from the list of screen layouts for various applications.
This includes many already-familiar panels Information, 3D视图,
Properties but also a new 逻辑编辑器 panel concerned solely with the BGE.

   渲染 Engine Menu.


.. rubric:: 2) Blender Game

Selected from the render engine menu.
This specifies that all output will be output by the real-time Blender 游戏引擎 renderer.
It also opens various other menu options such as the Game options (see below)
and a range of Properties for the BGE renderer properties (see below)

   Game Options.


.. rubric:: 3) Game

This menu gives various options for conditions for running the 游戏引擎.
Note that this menu is only available when the render engine is set to Blender Game.

Start Game
   Run game in 游戏引擎 (:kbd:`p` or :kbd:`Shift-P` when the mouse cursor is over the 3D视图 editor).
Show Debug Properties
   Show properties marked for debugging while game runs
Show framerate and profile
   :Show framerate and profiling information while game runs
Show 物理 visualization
   show a vizualisation of physics bounds and interactions
Deprecation warnings
   Print warnings when using deprecated features in the python API
Record animation
   Record animation to F-Curves
Auto Start
   Automatically start game at load time


.. rubric::  4) 逻辑编辑器 panel

The :doc:`逻辑编辑器 </editors/logic_editor>` is where the
:doc:`logic, properties and states </game_engine/logic/index>` are set up to control the behaviour of
the objects in the game.
(The 逻辑编辑器 panel can also be displayed by selecting 逻辑编辑器 in the Display Editor menu,
by pressing :kbd:`Shift-F2`, or by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-Right`).


.. rubric::  5) Properties

.. tip:: Two Meanings for the Same Word

   Note that the name "Property" has two different uses in Blender terminology -
   firstly in the wider use of the Property Display Panel as described here,
   and secondly as the term used for specific 游戏引擎 logic variables which are also called "properties".


The Property panel of the screen is selected as usual from the main Information menu.
However, note that several sections of the Property panel are changed when the render engine
(2) is changed from Blender 渲染 to Blender Game.

See following sections for details of the content of :doc:`物理 </game_engine/physics/index>` Properties panels.
