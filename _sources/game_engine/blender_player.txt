Standalone Player
*****************

The standalone player allows a Blender game to be run without having to load the Blender
system. This allows games to be distributed to other users,
without their requiring a detailed knowledge of Blender
(and also without the possibility of unauthorised modification). Note that the 游戏引擎
Save as Runtime is an add-on facility which must be pre-loaded before use.


The following procedure will give a standalone version of a working game.

#. :menuselection:`File --> 用户首选项 --> Add-ons --> 游戏引擎 --> Save As 游戏引擎 Runtime`
   enable the checkbox. (You can also :guilabel:`Save User 设置`,
   in which case the add-on will always be present whenever Blender is re-loaded).

#. :menuselection:`File --> Export --> Save As 游戏引擎 Runtime` 
   (give appropriate directory/filename) confirm with :guilabel:`Save as 游戏引擎 Runtime`.

The game can then be executed by running the appropriate .exe file.
Note that all appropriate libraries are automatically loaded by the add-on.

If you are interested in licensing your game, 
read `Licensing <https://www.blender.org/about/license/>`__
for a discussion of the issues involved.

.. tip:: Exporting...

   If the game is to be exported to other computers,
   make a new empty directory for the game runtime and all its ancilliary libraries etc.
   Then make sure the **whole** directory is transferred to the target computer
