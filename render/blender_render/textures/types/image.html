<h1>图像 Textures<a class="headerlink" href="#image-textures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The term <em>图像 Texture</em> simply means that a graphic image - a pixel grid
composed of R, G, B,
and sometimes Alpha values - is used as the input source to the texture.
As with other types of textures, this information can be used in a number of ways,
not only as a simple &#8220;decal&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the Texture Type <em>图像 or Movie</em> is selected, three new panels present
themselves allowing to control most aspects of how image textures are applied:
<em>图像</em>, <em>图像 Sampling</em>, and <em>图像 Mapping</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-image-based-texturing">
<h2>About 图像 Based Texturing<a class="headerlink" href="#about-image-based-texturing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Texture images take up precious memory space,
often being loaded into a special video memory bank that is very fast and very expensive,
so it is often very small. So, keep the images as small as possible.
A 64×64 image takes up only one fourth the memory of a 128×128 image.</p>
<p>For photo-realistic rendering of objects in animations, often larger image textures are used,
because the object might be zoomed in on in camera moves. In general, you want to use a
texture sized proportionally to the number of pixels that it will occupy in the final render.
Ultimately, you only have a certain amount of physical RAM to hold an image texture and the
model and to provide work space when rendering your image.</p>
<p>For the most efficient memory usage, image textures should be square,
with dimensions as powers of 2, such as 32×32, 64×64, 128×128, 256×256, 1024×1024, 2048×2048,
and 4096×4096.</p>
<p>If you can re-use images across different meshes, this greatly reduces memory requirements.
You can re-use images if you map those areas of the meshes that &#8220;look alike&#8221; to a layout that
uses the common image. In the overview below,
the left image is re-used for both the sphere and a portion of the monkey.
The monkey uses two layouts, one which has one UV map of a few faces,
and another that has three maps.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="../../../../_images/uv-overview.jpg" src="../../../../_images/uv-overview.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">How all the parts of UV Texturing work together.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When using file textures, it is very important that you have
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../../editors/uv_image/uv_editing/unwrapping.html"><span class="doc">Mapped the UVs</span></a>
of the mesh, and they are laid out appropriately.</p>
<p>You do not have to UV map the <em>entire</em> mesh.
The sphere above on the left has some faces mapped,
but other faces use procedural materials and textures.
Only use UV Textures for those portions of your mesh where you want very graphic,
precise detail. For example,
a model of a vase only needs UV Texture for the rim where decorative artwork is incorporated.
A throw pillow does not need a different image for the back as the front;
in fact many throw pillows have a fabric (procedural material) back.</p>
<p>As another example, you should UV map both eyes of a head to the same image
(unless you want one bloodshot and the other clear).
Mapping both sides of a face to the same image might not be advisable,
because the location of freckles and skin defects are not symmetrical.
You could of course change the UV map for one side of the face to slightly offset,
but it might be noticeable.
Ears are another example where images or section of an images can be mapped to similar faces.</p>

<h2>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process consists of the following steps.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create the Mesh. <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../editors/uv_image/uv_editing/unwrapping.html"><span class="doc">Unwrap</span></a> it into one or more
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../../editors/uv_image/uv_editing/layout_management.html"><span class="doc">UV Layouts</span></a>.</li>
<li>Create one or more Materials for the Mesh.</li>
<li>Create one or more images for each UV Layout and aspect of the texture. Either
- paint directly on the mesh using Texture Paint in the 3D视图,
- load and/or edit an image in the UV/图像编辑器, or
- Bake the existing materials into an image for the UV/图像编辑器.</li>
<li>Apply those images as UV Textures to the mesh to affect one or more aspects of the mesh.
This is done by using one or more of the numerous Map To options. For example,
- map to Color to affect the diffuse coloring of the mesh,
- map to Nor to affect the normal direction to give the surface a bumpy or creased look, or
- map to Spec (specularity) to make certain areas look shiny and oily.</li>
<li>Layer the Textures to create a convincing result.</li>

<h2>Using 图像s and Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#using-images-and-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To use an image as the color and alpha (transparency) of the texture, you can create an image
in an external paint program and tell the UV/图像编辑器 to Open that file as the texture,
or you can create a New image and save it as the texture.</p>
<p>If you want to start off by creating an image using an external paint program,
you will want to save an outline of your UV faces by using the <em>Save UV Face Layout</em> tool located in the UVs menu.
This is discussed <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../editors/uv_image/uv_editing/applying_image.html#uv-image-export-layout"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Creating an 图像 Texture<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-an-image-texture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To create an image within Blender,
you have to first create a <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../editors/uv_image/uv_editing/applying_image.html"><span class="doc">New Blank</span></a>
图像 with a uniform color or test grid.
After that, you can color the image using the:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Vertex colors as the basis for an image</li>
<li>渲染 Bake image based on how the mesh looks in the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created your image,
you can modify it using Blender&#8217;s built-in
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../../sculpt_paint/painting/texture_paint/introduction.html"><span class="doc">Texture Paint</span></a>
or any external image painting program.</p>

this is all that is required to have textures show up in Blender&#8217;s 游戏引擎. 渲染ing, however,
requires a material.

<h2>例子s<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There may be one UV Layout for the face of a character, and another for their clothes. Now,
to texture the clothes, you need to create an image at least for the Color of the clothes, and
possible a &#8220;bump&#8221; texture to give the fabric the appearance of some weave by creating a
different image for the Normal of the clothes. Where the fabric is worn,
for example at the elbows and knees, the sheen, or Specularity, of the fabric will vary and
you will want a different image that tells Blender how to vary the Specularity.
Where the fabric is folded over or creased,
you want another image that maps Displacement to the mesh to physically deform the mesh.
Each of these are examples of applying an image as a texture to the mesh.</p>
<p>As another example, the face is the subject of many questions and tutorials. In general,
you will want to create a Material that has the basic skin color, appropriate shaders,
and sub-surface scattering. Then you will want to layer on additional UV Textures for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Freckle map for Color and Normal aspects.</li>
<li>Subdermal veins and tendons for Displacement.</li>
<li>Creases and Wrinkles and skin cell stratification for Normal.</li>
<li>Makeup images for Color.</li>
<li>Oily maps for Specularity.</li>
<li>For a zombie, Alpha transparency where the flesh has rotted away.</li>
<li>Under chin and inside nostrils that receive less Ambient light.</li>
<li>Thin skin is more translucent, so a map is needed for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each image is mapped by using another Texture Channel.
Each of these maps are images which are applied to the different aspects (Color, Normal,
Specularity) of the image. Tileable images can be repeated to give a smaller,
denser pattern by using the Texture controls for repeat or size.</p>

<p>Great textures are formed by layering images on top of one another.
You start with a base layer, which is the base paint. Each successive layer on top of that is
somewhat transparent to let the bottom layers show through,
but opaque where you want to add on to details.</p>
<p>To avoid massive confusion, all image textures for a mesh usually use the same UV map.
If you do, each image will line up with the one below it,
and they will layer on top of one another like the examples shown to the right. To do this,
just create one UV Texture (map) as described in this section. Then,
create material image textures as described in the procedural materials section.
Instead of mapping to Original Coordinates (OrCo), map to UV.</p>
<p>Use that map name repeatedly in the <span class="menuselection">Material ‣ Textures ‣ Map Input</span>
panel by selecting <span class="guilabel">UV</span> and typing the name in the text field. In the example to the right,
our UV Texture is called &#8220;Head&#8221; (you may have to expand the image to see the panel settings).
Then, the image texture shown will be mapped using the UV coordinates.
In the &#8220;Base UV Texture&#8221; example to the right, the face has two textures UV mapped;
one for a base color, and another for spots, blemishes and makeup.</p>
<p>Both textures use the same UV Texture map as their Map Input, and both affect Color.
The Makeup texture is transparent except where there is color,
so that the base color texture shows through.
Note that the colors were too strong on the image,
so they amount of Col affects is turned down to 60% in the second layer (the blemish layer).</p>
<p>Normally, we think of image textures affecting the color of a mesh. Realism and
photo-realistic rendering is a combination of many different ways that light interacts with
the surface of the mesh. The image texture can be Mapped To not only color,
but also <em>Normal</em> (bumpiness)
or <em>Reflection</em> or any of the other attributes specified in the Map To panel.</p>
<p>If you paint a grey-scale image (laid out according to the UV Layout)
with white where the skin is oily and shiny, and dark where it is not,
you would map that input image according to the UV Layout, but have it affect Specularity
(not color).</p>
<p>To make portions of a mesh transparent and thus reveal another mesh surface underneath,
you would paint a grey-scale image with black where you want the texture transparent,
map input to UV, and map it to Alpha (not color). To make portions of a mesh,
like a piece of hot metal, appear to glow, you would use a grey-scale image mapped to Emit.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is only &#8220;the tip of the iceberg!&#8221; If everything that is been described
here just is not enough for you, the <em>texture nodes</em> feature,
introduced in recent versions of Blender,
enables you to layer and combine textures in almost any way you can imagine.</p>

<div class="section" id="mix-and-match-materials">
<h3>Mix and Match Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#mix-and-match-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="../../../../_images/uv-mixmat.jpg" src="../../../../_images/uv-mixmat.jpg" />
</div>
<p>You can mix and match procedural materials and textures, vertex paint,
and UV textures onto the same mesh.</p>
<p>The image to the right has a world with a red ambient light.
The material has both VCol Paint and Face Textures enabled,
and receives half of ambient light. A weak cloud texture affects color, mixing in a tan color.
The right vertices are vertex painted yellow and the left is unpainted procedural gray.
The UV Texture is a stock arrow image from the public domain texture CD.
Scene lighting is a white light off to the right.
From this information and the User Manual thus far,
you should now be able to recreate this image.</p>
<p>You can also assign <a class="reference internal" href="../../materials/multiple_materials.html"><span class="doc">multiple materials</span></a>
to the mesh based on which faces you want to be procedural and which you want to be texture-mapped.
Just do not UV map the faces you want to be procedural.</p>
<p>You can use UV Textures and VertexPaint (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">V</span></code> in the 3D视图) simultaneously,
if both are enabled in the Material settings.
The vertex colors are used to modulate the brightness or color of the UV image texture:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>UV Texture is at the base <em>(Face Textures)</em></li>
<li>Vertex paint affects its colors, then</li>
<li>Procedural textures are laid on top of that,</li>
<li>Area lights shine on the surface, casting shadows and what not, and finally</li>
<li>Ambient light lights it up.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Vertex colors modulate texture.</span></p>
</div>
<p>A UV Layout can only have one image, although you can tile and animate the image.
Since a layout is a bunch of arranged UV Maps, and a UV Map maps many mesh faces,
a face can therefore only have one UV Texture image,
and the UV coordinates for that face must fit entirely on the image.
If you want a face to have multiple images, split the face into parts,
and assign each part its own image. <em>(Or</em> you can get fancy with 节点,
but that is another story ...)</p>

<h3>Using Alpha Transparency<a class="headerlink" href="#using-alpha-transparency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Alpha 0.0 (transparent) areas of a UV 图像 render as black.
Unlike a procedural texture, they do not make the base material transparent,
since UV Textures do not operate on the base procedural material.
The UV texture overrides any procedural color underneath.
Procedural Textures are applied on top of UV Textures,
so a procedural image texture would override any UV Texture. Transparent (black)
areas of a procedural texture mapped to alpha operate on top of anything else,
making the object transparent in those places.
The only thing that modulates visible parts of a UV Texture are the Vertex Colors.
In the example to the right,
the finger image is transparent at the cuff and top of the finger and is used as a UV Texture.
All three balls have a base material of blue and a marbling texture.
The base material color is not used whenever Face Textures is enabled.</p>
<p>The top left ball has not had any vertex painting,
and the finger is mapped to the middle band, and the texture is mapped to a pink color.
As you can see, the base material has VCol Paint and Face Textures enabled;
the base color blue is not used, but the texture is. With no vertex painting,
there is nothing to modulate the UV Texture colors, so the finger shows as white.
Transparent areas of the UV 图像 show as black.</p>
<p>The top right ball has had a pink vertex color applied to the vertical band of faces
(in the 3D视图 editor, select the faces in UV Paint Mode, switch to 顶点绘制模式,
pick a pink color, and <span class="menuselection">Paint ‣ Set Vertex Colors</span>).
The finger is mapped to the middle vertical band of faces,
and VCol and Face Textures are enabled.
The texture is mapped to Alpha black and multiplies the base material alpha value which is 1.0.
Thus, white areas of the texture are 1.0, and 1.0 times 1.0 is 1.0
so that area is opaque and shows. Black areas of the procedural texture, 0.0,
multiply the base material to be transparent. As you can see, the unmapped faces
(left and right sides of the ball) show the vertex paint (none, which is gray)
and the painted ones show pink, and the middle stripe that is both painted and mapped change
the white UV Texture areas to pink.
Where the procedural texture says to make the object transparent,
the green background shows through.
Transparent areas of the UV Texture insist on rendering black.</p>
<p>The bottom ball uses multiple materials. Most of the ball (all faces except the middle band)
is a base material that does not have Face Textures (nor Vertex Color Paint - VCol Paint)
enabled. Without it enabled,
the base blue material color shows and the pink color texture is mixed on top.
The middle band is assigned a new material (2 Mat 2)
that <em>does</em> have vertex paint and Face Textures enabled.
The middle band of faces were vertex painted yellow,
so the white parts of the finger are yellow. Where the pink texture runs over the UV texture,
the mixed color changes to green, since pink and yellow make a green.</p>
<p>If you want the two images to show through one another, and mix together,
you need to use Alpha. The base material can have an image texture with an Alpha setting,
allowing the underlying UV Texture to show through.</p>
<p>To overlay multiple UV images, you have several options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create multiple UV Textures which map the same,
and then use different images (with Alpha) and Blender will overlay them automatically.</li>
<li>Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../../compositing/index.html"><span class="doc">Composite 节点</span></a> to combine the two images via the AlphaOver node,
creating and saving the composite image. Open that composited image as the UV Texture.</li>
<li>Use an external paint program to alpha overlay the images and save the file,
and load it as the face&#8217;s UV Texture</li>
<li>Define two objects, one just inside the other.
The inner object would have the base image,
and the outer image the overlaid image with a material alpha less than one (1.0).</li>
<li>Use the <a class="reference internal" href="../../materials/nodes/index.html"><span class="doc">Material nodes</span></a>
to combine the two images via the AlphaOver or Mix node,
thus creating a third noded material that you use as the material for the face.
Using this approach, you will not have to UV map;
simply assign the material to the face using the Multiple Materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>UV Textures vs. Procedural Textures<a class="headerlink" href="#uv-textures-vs-procedural-textures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Material Texture, that has a Map Input of UV,
and is an image texture that is mapped to Color, is equivalent to a UV Texture.
It provides much more flexibility, because it can be sized and offset, and the degree to which
it affects the color of your object can be controlled in the Map To panel. In addition,
you can have different images for each texture channel; one for color, one for alpha,
one for normals, one for specularity, one for reflectivity, <em>etc.</em> Procedural textures,
like Clouds, are incredibly simple and useful for adding realism and details to an image.</p>

<p>So, in a sense, a single UV texture for a mesh is simpler but more limited than using multiple textures
(mapped to UV coordinates), because they do one specific thing very well:
adding image details to a range of faces of a mesh. They work together if the procedural
texture maps to the UV coordinates specified in your layout. As discussed earlier, you can map
multiple UV textures to different images using the UV Coordinate mapping system in the Map
Input panel.</p>
